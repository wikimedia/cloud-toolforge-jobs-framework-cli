# The forcediphttpsadapter mode is not in any Debian archive. But dh-python3 is
# so smart that introduces a dependency at toolforge-jobs binary runtime, which
# breaks because the module is not installed in the system (via pip or any
# other alternative method).
# This line here tells dh-python3 that python3:any satisfaces the dependency,
# which is fake, but we don't care because the forcediphttpsadapter module
# is mostly useful for development environment anyway. If we decide that the
# module is also useful in a Toolforge production setting, we would need to
# figure out something more robust.
